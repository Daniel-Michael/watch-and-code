Watch & Code Premium - Testing
Simple Test

This is a series of test written during the Watch & Code Premium content.

The goal is to recreate the native functions outlined in Gordon's course using the principle of test-driven development taught.

My process is:

Open a blank Chrome tab with about:blank in the URL, right click and inspect.

Use the Console to test the native function to gain an understanding of how it works. 
eg:

// myArray = [-2, 0, 5, 9, 36, 7.2, -222];
// var found = myArray.find(function(firstMatch) {
//  return firstMatch > 0;
// });
// console.log(found); /* expected output 5 because it is the first element greater than 0 in the array */

Use this basic as the foundation for prototype implmentation. 

Write out test as simply as possible exactly what the requirements should be.
